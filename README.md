🧩 How It Works
1. Add Task

Users can enter a task name and select a date. Clicking Add Task stores the task in an array and displays it on the page.

2. Display Tasks

The renderTasks() function loops through the stored tasks and displays each one dynamically.

3. Delete Task

Each task has a delete button that removes it from the list.
